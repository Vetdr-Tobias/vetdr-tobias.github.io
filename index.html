									<p>Do you want to have a restaurant in Mexico and probably you’re not armed with meaningful info about the industry in Mexico? What about cuisines? Ok, look no further, because you can rely on information provided by this #powerbi visualization dashboard to get a little insight into restaurants in Mexico, especially in the states of San Luis Potosi, Morelos, and Tamaulipas. This video is a visualization dashboard for my Project on Restaurant ratings in Mexico Key Insights: * Top 6 cuisines are Mexican, Bar, Cafeteria, Fast Food, Brewery, and American cuisines. * 69.47% of the consumers are on a medium budget. * In terms of the consumers’ social lifestyle,34.35% of the non-drinking consumers do not smoke as well. * 62.32% of the consumers reside in the state of San Luis Potosi while 81.68% of the consumers are students and single. * More than 50% of the consumers rated the restaurants poorly in terms of food (cuisines) and services they provide. This means that any new brand with better food and services will be the star of attraction for these consumers. *There is a huge Demand and Supply Gap between cuisines and restaurants offering them in their menu.</p>

									<p>Dan Heath said “𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐣𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐬𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 - 𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐥 𝐚 𝐟𝐞𝐰 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐡𝐞𝐥𝐩 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐟𝐮𝐥”. And so I created this #powerbi visualization dashboard to tell a few stories about Taxi trips in New York City from 2017 to 2020, using a dataset on Green Taxi trips in New York City courtesy of Quantum Analytics NG. This video is a visualization dashboard for NYC Taxi Project. Key Insights: * In the period under review (2017-2020), 39.8million passengers did 29.3millon trips at an average fare price of $12.8 per trip while 1.8 minutes is the average minutes per trip. * There were 261 taxi zones for 4 service zones in 6 boroughs. * 50.96% of the passengers preferred to pay for their trip using credit cards while 49.04% paid using cash. * Highest number of trips were done in 2018 while 2019 did the least number of trips. * The borough of Brooklyn at approximately $163m generated the highest revenue; East Harlem North zone at approximately $24m generated the highest revenue among the zones. For the service zone, the Boro zone at approximately $438m generated the highest revenue. * In the period under review, more trips were made in the months of March (9.65%) and Saturdays (16.39%) *At 33.18%,6.32%, and 98.31%, Brooklyn Borough, East Harlem North Zone, and Boro Service Zone respectively contributed more passengers to these trips. *Boro zone did approximately 29 million trips (98.31%), East Harlem North did approximately 19 million trips while for Brooklyn zone it is approximately 9.7 million trips. * Busiest period is in the late evening with the peak being around 6:00 PM.</p>

									<p>This is my favorite part about analytics: Taking boring flat data and bringing it to life through visualization ~ John Tukey. I totally agree. This #powerbi visualization dashboard gave life and meaning to these boring flat Bitcoin historical data. This video is a visualization dashboard for Bitcoin Historical Data at 1-min intervals from Jan 2012 to March 2021. Key Insights: *The total volume of Bitcoin in the period under review is 33.7 million with a market value of $151bn *2015 Bitcoin at 5.5 million recorded the highest volume while in 2021 Bitcoin at $35bn recorded the highest volume value. *All-Time High in the period under review was $61.8k while All-Time Low was $1.5 *On average Bitcoin price at approximately $45k was highest in 2021. *In terms of price movement, on average there was a huge leap from 2012 to 2021. For example, Bitcoin's average price opened at around $10.09 in 2012 and closed at approximately $44.9k in 2021. This validated the “Bitcoin is a technological tour de force,” statement by Bill Gates, Founder of Microsoft.</p>

									<p>This video is a #Powerbi visualization dashboard for my Project on Covid-19 in Nigeria. I got the dataset for this project from Nigerian Centre for Disease and Control [NCDC], website. Key Insights: * 255,889 is the total laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Nigeria of which 97.7% of them have been discharged while 1.08% of the confirmed cases are still active in Nigeria. Unfortunately, 1.23% of the confirmed cases have died of the virus. *Lagos state with 99,398 confirmed cases is the most affected state in Nigeria. FCT, Rivers, Kaduna, and Plateau states complete the list of the Top 5 most affected states in Nigeria. * In descending order Top 5 states with the greatest number of people that died of the virus are Lagos, Edo, FCT, Oyo, and Rivers states. 769 is the number of victims of covid-19 that died of the virus in Lagos state. *Discharged Covid-19 cases: 98.66% of the confirmed cases in Lagos state have been discharged. 99% for FCT, 98.9% for Rivers, 99.06% for Kaduna and 99.23% for Plateau etc. *Dead Covid-19 cases: 0.77% of the confirmed cases in Lagos state have died of the virus. 0.87% for FCT, 0.92% for Rivers, 0.79% for Kaduna and 0.73% for Plateau etc.</p>

									<p>This video is a #Powerbi visualization dashboard for my Project on Sales Report of an Unnamed company in the USA [2018 – 2019]. Quantum Analytics NG provided the data for this project. Key Insights: *$2M revenue was generated by 8 sales persons in 4 regions from 2000 orders for 9,119 products. *The highest revenue [$230K] was generated in the months of March while the months of December generated the least amount [$91K] of revenue. *Most numbers of the products were sold in the months of May. For this particular insight you may ask if May had the highest quantity of products sold, why then is March the month with the highest generated revenue. The reason is that costlier products [Item 1] were sold more in the months of March than any other month. *Anna Weber and Laura Larsen at approximately $276K are the Top 2 salespeople in this company with Anna edging it a little $77K more than Laura. *Texas Region with $532K is on top in terms of regions with the most amount of revenue generated. *Compared to 2019, the year 2018 generated the most revenue [$1.2M], orders [1,146], and had the most quantity of the products sold [5,259]. *Among the sales persons, Laura Larsen in the year 2018 contributed more revenue than others while in the year 2019, it was Anna Weber that generated more revenue than others. *For the regions, California contributed more revenue in 2018 while Texas contributed more revenue in the year 2019. *In 2018, the month of May generated more revenue and had more products sold as well while in 2019, it was the month of March.</p>

									<p>As they say, Data Analysts are artists, so I created another artistic data visualization dashboard – POWER BI, from a Call Centre Dataset Provided by Quantum Analytics NG. IN SUMMARY *Count/No of resolved calls for Y (3,646) was higher than not resolved N (1,354). Y counted for 72.92% of the count of resolved. *Count of Call-ID Answered out of Total Call-ID of 5000 that came in where 4,054. Thus 946 calls were not answered. *The average count of Answered calls was higher for Y (1,351) than for N (315.33). *January in Answered Y/N made up 29.10% of 5,000 counts of Call-ID. The Count of Call-ID for Answered Y & N diverged the most when the month was January. Here Y was 1,138 higher than N. *At 35,717, the call agent called Martha had the highest speed of Answer in seconds & was 13.14% higher than that of Steward, who had the lowest speed of Answer (in seconds) at 31,570. *Across all the 8 agents, the speed of Answer ranges from 31,570 to 35,717. RECOMMENDATION: The management of the call Centre should try to motivate the Call Centre agents so as to improve the overall average speed of answer and number of resolved issues in order to have at least an overall average satisfaction rating of 4. PS: Y=YES, N=NO.</p>

									<p>Visualizing they say, is better. This is a visual display of key insights derived from a consolidated sales data set of a group of products in Canada. The Key insights are · *Total Revenue · *Total Quantity sold · *Average Revenue · *No of manufacturers · *Sales trend · *Top 10 Products by Revenue · *Top 3 States by Revenue · *Trends by Quantity (Unit) Sold · *Revenue Contribution by category ***The visual display revealed two major patterns in the sales data set, which are 1. An increase in quantity (units) of the product sold resulted in an increase in sales in corresponding months under review and vice versa. 2. The products are not for people living in the rural environment as the Rural category contributed just 9% to the revenue against 87% from those of the Urban category. These may be due to differences in income earnings or education (product enlightenment). Thus the data-driven decision/action that can be taken here is that organization should focus more on the Urban areas especially in the months of March and April while educating the rural populace about their products.</p>
